# @kontourai/station-sdk

## 0.8.0

### Minor Changes

- 4f19d35: Add a Device-bound, proof-of-possession account-session continuation for virtual
  transports. Keep provider sessions server-owned, enforce current revocation and
  response delivery, and preserve independent Device credentials on account refusal.
- b6dcb8c: Add optional durable authority identities to Project query and reorder cache keys,
  and captured-origin startup reads with guarded cache seeding. Live request
  authority remains separate from persistent data identity.
- 058376c: Expose exact input-request reply context and a guarded foreground reply constraint. Reuse scoped attachment staging for file and image answers.
- e4d61c8: Expose monitoring event windows with explicit truncation, retain the existing array API, and reject malformed history responses. Avoid opening the live stream when querying all history.
- 519f361: Extend chat contracts and SDK clients with bounded file and conversation references, streamed delivery metadata, tool-purpose projections, and owner-bound workspace checkpoint preview/restore. Add the corresponding CLI checkpoint commands and shared runtime projection fields while preserving existing event and authorization boundaries.
- b8417e5: Add bounded newest-first conversation history hydration and recover complete terminal text from a retained suffix. Expose full saved Station addresses and host-owned native profile editing without forwarding credentials to a changed origin.
- 7ef36cc: Add enrolled cloud target verification with stable boot observation, redirect refusal, bounded responses and no execution authority transfer.
- a8bbc67: Add exact Conversation pull-request links and provider-observed revision fields.
- 31278d5: Add the opt-in portable delegation attempt correlation: `DelegateTaskInput.attemptId` plus the authorized exact-attempt lookup (`lookupDelegationAttempt` / `DelegationAttemptView`). The view carries the claim state, the reserved receiver task reference for every known claim, and the exact initial turn id when accepted, so a lost acknowledgement resolves to that task and turn without re-POSTing. Never a prompt, path, digest, transcript, or provider output.
- 1344781: Record recovery-from-copy provenance atomically with an offline home restore. Show the snapshot time and explicit absence of transferred execution authority in CLI and JSON output, and expose a bounded read-only recovery-record reader.
  
  Expose a host-scoped system-status disclosure and show a persistent browser recovery notice with snapshot time and explicit authority limits.
- c5a4cf2: Add captured-actor preconditions for Project access mutations and an explicit,
  operator-approved collaborator-management Device scope choice. Invited admins
  can manage people and invitation links without receiving terminal access.
- c3474f5: Expose optional operator-configured browser identity choices alongside Station
  local accounts, with verified OIDC callbacks and independent account sessions.
- eb1fd17: Add host-neutral mobile device inventory and single-frame capture contracts, with an authenticated SDK subpath that validates the selected target. Honor optional response byte ceilings for JSON POST responses as well as GET requests.
- fa6338a: Delegated turn supervision can now be idle-only. `DelegatedTaskTurnSupervision.deadlineAt`, `remainingMs` and `totalLimitMs` (SDK) and `TurnSupervisionFacts.deadlineAt`/`totalLimitMs` (contracts) are optional and present together only when a total turn budget was declared; Muse declares none by default. Consumers that read them as always-present numbers must handle their absence. Contracts also add `MUSE_TURN_IDLE_TIMEOUT_CODE`/`MUSE_TURN_TOTAL_TIMEOUT_CODE` and widen the `tool.completed` status documentation (`unresolved` at a one-turn engine's turn end, engine-reported `cancelled`).
- 5570767: Muse turns no longer have a default idle bound (#2269). `TurnSupervisionFacts.idleLimitMs` (contracts) and `DelegatedTaskTurnSupervision.idleLimitMs` (SDK) are now optional and present only when an idle bound was declared for the turn; a Muse turn with no declared bound publishes a declaration with neither `idleLimitMs` nor a total budget. Consumers that read `idleLimitMs` as an always-present number must handle its absence. `station delegate status` prints "Idle limit: none declared for this turn" for such a turn.
- a777b37: Add typed portable Project identity snapshots and explicit receiver-local associations, with SDK methods to read, prepare and attach an identity. Reject incompatible responses and preserve the requested association through asynchronous work.
  
  Attachment publishes a new local Project and its imported identity together without changing existing Project history, copying paths into shared identity, or granting membership or execution authority.
- 272c29b: Carry an optional repository-relative execution root in portable Project identities.
- 4d38391: Add scoped Project membership and invitation administration, built-in local
  username account entry and operator account/session recovery controls. Keep
  account authentication, Project membership and device/compute grants independent.
- e5dfb04: Add an authenticated SDK and CLI workflow for setting or clearing portable Project execution roots.
- 3a64f5f: Expose portable Project identity export/preparation and explicit destination
  attachment through the CLI, reusing the public identity SDK and receiver validation.
- 6e9c63e: Add review-bound operator controls for publishing and revoking shared Tasks with
  exact Project, Task, share, and request-authority identity.
- 44c019b: Add bounded pull-request review snapshots, exact-head review outcomes, and a scoped review client. Merge inputs may carry the reviewed head SHA as a provider precondition.
- c00ee0c: Allow Project list and detail queries to bind their cache and HTTP reads to an
  explicit Station request authority while preserving deliberate legacy callers.
- 797b975: Type the host context hooks and knowledge results (#2399, #2400).
  
  - `useAgents`, `useNavigation`, `useToast` and `useAuth` now return the
    published `AgentSummary[]`, `SDKNavigation`, `SDKToast` and `SDKAuthState`
    contracts instead of `any`. Code that read members outside a contract stops
    compiling. `SDKNavigation` does not expose these host navigation members:
    `updateParams`, `setAgent`, `setDockMode`, `collapseMaximizedDock`,
    `dockMode`, `selectedLayout`, `activeWorkspacePane` and `fontSize`.
  - `SDKContextValue`'s `agents`, `navigation`, `toast` and `auth` slots are
    typed by `SDKAgentsContext`, `SDKNavigationContext`, `SDKToastContext` and
    `SDKAuthContext`, so a host must satisfy them.
  - `showToast` accepts `(message, type?, duration?)` or a `ToastRequest` object,
    which now also takes `actions`.
  - The knowledge tree, document list, filtered list and namespace queries return
    `KnowledgeTreeNode`, `KnowledgeDocumentMeta[]` and
    `KnowledgeNamespaceConfig[]`; `KnowledgeTreeNode` and `KnowledgeSearchFilter`
    are exported. `AgentSummary` gains an optional `plugin`.
  - `useSendToChat` widens to accept a plugin-qualified `'<plugin>:<agent>'`
    reference as well as an `AgentId`; it sends only when the named plugin
    contributed that Agent. `AgentId` and `QualifiedPluginAgentId` are exported.
  - Fix: `useDockState` read a `dockState` field the host never provided, so
    `isOpen` was always false; it now reads `isDockOpen`.
  - `NavigationState` is deprecated in favour of `SDKNavigation`.
- 687d586: Add explicit account-bound Device approval and guest-only Project view contracts.
  Expose validated Project view APIs while keeping personal full-configuration APIs
  separate. Require deliberate operator approval mode selection in the pairing UI
  and CLI, and retain current account and Project membership as independent access
  requirements. This is a view-only pilot; shared execution and complete guest
  onboarding retain their separate delivery requirements.
- a2c21d7: Add explicit shared Task publication and bounded Project-member reads for Task
  summaries, human-message history, and text snapshots. Recheck current Device,
  account, Project, publication, and Task authority before releasing content.
- be60151: Expose a bounded, currently authorized answer quotation source with exact Session, turn, message and text-revision identity.
- 09bd7e6: Add applied registry-policy and untrusted package-claim contracts, explicit Node signing/digest leaves, and root/dependency trust-review transport. Keep signer fingerprints distinct from publisher identity and preserve offline retained recovery.
  
  Release the fixed contracts/shared/SDK group together. Shared and CLI dependency floors must include the contracts release containing the new public leaves; unreleased same-version candidate tarballs require an explicit override throughout the consumer graph and do not prove npm availability.

### Patch Changes

- 2dad041: Allow account-session reads to accept an abort signal so authority-sensitive
  guest views can cancel stale requests when the Station or signed-in account
  changes.
- e4d61c8: Wake API initialization readers directly, bound diagnostic telemetry, and separate MCP transport construction from custody while preserving the published API.
  
  Align plugin preview component and conflict kinds with the emitted layout contract and share those types with server and UI producers.
  
  Canonicalize newly allocated temporary homes before admission so read-only source observation shares the writer home identity.
- ecfa545: Invalidate feedback guidelines and status after ratings are saved or removed, so clients refresh derived preferences and pending-analysis state.
  
  Preserve configured cache invalidations when a successful mutation's observer throws, while keeping that observer failure visible to its caller.
- 2ae242b: LayoutHeader: `canLaunchPrompts`. An optional prop a host sets to `false` when it has no prompt launcher; the header then renders no prompt action, global skill, tab prompt or quick-actions menu instead of rendering them wired to a no-op. `external` and `internal` actions still render. Absent keeps the previous behaviour.
- 390ea80: Declare the Zod runtime dependency used by account authentication, local accounts, and project access clients so they resolve outside the Station workspace.

## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- 1fc735a: Publish the Surface 3 answer-assessment v2 binding, protected assessment update
  notifications, and Basis pane integration as the Station public contract.
- 5cb0aaa: Add the public exact-answer retained-narrative producer binding contract and client.
- 3f6b3c2: Publish Whole Task Basis collection v4 and portable MCP page v3. The new
  mandatory retained Process stream carries kept Flow gate-evaluation projections
  independently of answers and never supplies Task aggregate standing.

## 0.6.0

### Minor Changes

- a04a5f1: Add exact, authority-scoped tool-result inspection and identity-only Keep actions
  to Basis. Whole Task collections use v3 and portable MCP pages use v2 with an
  independently bounded kept-result stream. Connect exposes non-secret activation
  epochs; SDK invocations and response bodies reject replaced read authorities.
  Execution results remain separate from semantic answer support.
- d926a67: Expose exact authorized terminal tool-result reads and identity-only Task Keep
  operations through typed clients and CLI commands. Protected reads validate
  Thread projections, withhold stale content, and preserve generic failure states.

### Patch Changes

- 214eb24: Add typed execution-client methods for reserving, reading, and cancelling conversation context boundaries.
- 8680665: Expose scheduler monitor configuration through the typed scheduler client.
- f37bdbb: Expose versioned conversation intent summaries through the chat runtime SDK.
- 0704b6b: Add portable attachment staging client operations for capability, preparation, upload, reconciliation, and cancellation.
- 6905e5f: Add explicit-apiBase and React query access to the read-only usage rollup.

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- fd9a422: Use behavior-specific names for pre-release contracts.
  
  - Runtime model catalogs now expose `source: 'built-in'` and `builtInModels`.
  - A model launch with no capability declaration records
    `evidence: 'capability-absent'`.
  - The built-in policy guard records `engine: 'typescript'`.
  - Device-setting definitions use `priorStorageKey` and `priorRead` for values
    imported from pre-unification browser storage.
  - Composed voice roles use `secondary`, and the provider-composition adapter is
    exported as `ProviderVoiceSessionAdapter` /
    `createProviderVoiceSessionAdapter`.
  - Knowledge import helpers are named `migratePreIndexKnowledge` and
    `useMigratePreIndexKnowledgeMutation`.
  - The synthesized local-only project resource helper is named
    `localProjectResourceId`.
  
  Update pre-release callers and fixtures directly; removed identifiers and
  serialized values are not read as aliases. Development homes with stored
  session events using the removed model-plan or policy-engine values should be
  recreated before reuse. The project resource observation record is now version
  2 with a `baseline` dimension; remove `project-resource-shadow.json` from a
  development home to begin a new observation record when upgrading from version
  1.
- 051d372: Document the Station-local Datum secret-binding contract: binding metadata is
  not portable, and clients must treat environment hints as credential-free.
- 278bf3b: Both Review Queue read projections are now total over the project inventory,
  and both changed their published return type to say so.
  
  - `listAllReviewReceipts` / `fetchIndependentReviewReceipts` /
    `useReviewEvidenceQuery` resolve to `ReviewEvidenceAggregate`
    (`{ receipts, unavailableProjects }`) instead of
    `IndependentReviewReceipt[]`. `ReviewEvidenceAggregate`,
    `ReviewEvidenceUnavailableProject`, `REVIEW_EVIDENCE_UNAVAILABLE_REASONS`
    and `parseReviewEvidenceAggregate` are new contracts exports.
  - `fetchSurveyFlowReviews` / `useSurveyFlowReviewsQuery` resolve to
    `SurveyFlowReviewsVM` (`{ items, unavailableProjects }`) instead of
    `SurveyFlowReviewItemVM[]`, with `SurveyFlowReviewUnavailableReason` naming
    the derived reason a project could not be read.
  
  A project Station cannot read contributes zero rows plus one
  `unavailableProjects` entry carrying its reason, rather than failing the whole
  read — one corrupt file used to 500 an entire Review Queue source.
  
  Callers destructure the collection instead of consuming the array directly;
  this is a breaking export change, expressed as a minor while these packages are
  pre-1.0. The survey fetcher's compat adapter covers the old-server /
  new-client direction only — it accepts a bare item array from a Station that
  predates the aggregate. It does nothing for an old client reading a new
  server, which needs this release.

### Patch Changes

- 9d85cd8: Add a portable, typed plugin collection fetcher shared by SDK hooks, the Station CLI, and station-control MCP.
- 426d121: Delegation creation now projects only authored prompt, target, and optional
  parent-task input. Conversation and session handles remain server-produced
  response identities.
